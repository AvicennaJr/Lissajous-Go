# A Lissajous Figure

A Lissajous curve, also known as Lissajous figure or Bowditch curve, is the graph of a system of parametric equations x=A\sin, \quad y=B\sin, which describe the superposition of two perpendicular oscillations in x and y directions of different angular frequency. These were a staple visual effect in sci-fi films of the 1960s
